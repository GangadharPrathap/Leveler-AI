      <strong>Hockey 101: The Fundamentals</strong><br><br>
      Field hockey is a fast-paced, tactical team sport that demands a high level of skill, stamina, and spatial awareness. It enhances **reflexes, hand-eye coordination, teamwork**, and **strategic decision-making**. Played on turf with a curved stick and a hard ball, the game promotes discipline, focus, and physical fitness while offering strong camaraderie and international appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key Aspects of Field Hockey:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rules & Scoring:</strong> Learn match structure (four quarters of 15 minutes), goal-scoring criteria, fouls (like stick obstruction or foot contact), penalty corners, and card system (green, yellow, red).</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Skills:</strong> Master dribbling, passing, receiving, shooting, tackling, and aerial skills. Stick handling techniques include push pass, hit, slap shot, reverse sweep, and drag flick.</li>

        <li><strong>Strategy & Tactics:</strong> Develop tactics like pressing, counterattacks, zonal marking, and set plays during penalty corners. Learn how formations (like 4-3-3 or 3-4-3) influence play style and ball distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness & Conditioning:</strong> Hockey requires agility, speed bursts, stamina, and recovery. Training involves interval running, dynamic drills, strength training, and recovery practices tailored to turf movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Understand hockey sticks (length, weight, bow types), protective gear (shin guards, mouthguards), turf shoes, gloves, and goalkeeper equipment. Choose gear based on your position and play style.</li>
        <li><strong>History & Culture:</strong> Discover hockey’s roots in ancient civilizations and its modern evolution in Europe and India. Learn about Olympic history, World Cup moments, and legends like Dhyan Chand and Rani Rampal.</li>
