      <strong>Golf 101: The Fundamentals</strong><br><br>
      Golf is a precision sport that emphasizes technique, strategy, and mental discipline over speed or strength. Played individually or in pairs, the objective is to hit the ball into a series of holes using as few strokes as possible. Golf enhances **concentration, patience, balance**, and **course management skills**, offering both a personal challenge and a social experience in beautifully landscaped settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key Aspects of Golf:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rules & Scoring:</strong> Golf is typically played over 18 holes. Each hole has a "par" (expected strokes). The player with the lowest total strokes wins. Key rules involve ball placement, penalty strokes, and course etiquette.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Skills:</strong> Learn essential shots including the drive, chip, pitch, bunker shot, and putt. Master different club types (woods, irons, wedges, putters) and shot techniques for varying distances and terrains.</li>
        <li><strong>Course Layout & Strategy:</strong> Golf courses include tee boxes, fairways, bunkers, rough, water hazards, and greens. Strategy involves club selection, wind assessment, and shot planning based on course conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness & Conditioning:</strong> Golfers benefit from flexibility, core strength, and balance training. Regular practice also includes swing drills, putting accuracy, and mental focus exercises.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Understand the composition and use of a golf set (typically 14 clubs), golf balls, gloves, shoes, tees, and rangefinders. Proper equipment can enhance precision and comfort on the course.</li>
        <li><strong>Golf Formats:</strong> Common formats include stroke play, match play, four-ball, and scramble. Tournaments can be individual or team-based, with variations used in amateur and professional events.</li>
        <li><strong>History & Culture:</strong> Golf originated in Scotland and is now played worldwide. Iconic tournaments include The Masters, The Open Championship, U.S. Open, and PGA Championship. India's presence is growing through players like Anirban Lahiri and Aditi Ashok.</li>
